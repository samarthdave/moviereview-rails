# MovieReview
a rails project to review movies

Honestly, using Rails is where I truly internalized CRUD and what (most) websites really offer or how it is all implemented. Really, projects like this enabled me gain a deeper respect of online services or at least what they're doing behind the scenes.

This code is old but I distinctly remember this being a fun project. But don't expect good practices or clean syntax. I think this is a testament to change and growth.
